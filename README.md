# Final Project: "DeDe" 

"DeDe" the Designated Driver app that helps you track your social drinking habits, assists in managing your nights out and hooks you up with a designated driver based on your set needs! 

## Getting Started: 

How I began: I was stuck inside a bar in Ft. Lauderdale during a hurricane and amazed by the breathalyzer machines on the wall. I thought how cool would it be if you could have one on the go, for your phone. An app to remind you when to drink water, and call you a cab when you've reached your limit. The app could go one step further and the user could set their own parameters such as "after 3 drinks shut down my social media so I don't accidentally post any inappropriate selfies and get into a Facebook arguement with my super judgy distant cousin", or "after 4 drinks here's a list of people I can not text: my boss, my ex, the person I have a crush on".

So I guess you could surmise I was inspired by my own poor decisions and created "DeDe: the Designated Driver app." DeDe is just for fun, and largely depends on the user to make sure they're adding in their drinks so that DeDe can remind them of when to wait an hour before their next drink, hydrate, shut down their set parameters on their phone and most importantly, call a ride for them if they're over the .08 limit. 

But wait, there's more DeDe has to offer! DeDe will also keep track of the users caloric intake and monetary spending. One of the biggest things people don't think about when they've had a few adult beverages is how many calories they're consuming, just cranberry and orange juice alone have so much sugar in them! When the user adds their drinks consumed on a night out into their Database, DeDe will give an average total at the end of the night...sometimes looking back to see that only 3 glasses of wine was as many calories as a triple bacon cheeseburger really puts your consumption into perspective when you think "I'll just have one more glass, or maybe I shouldn't." 

DeDe will also give an average total (based on a national Database of average price for drinks) so that the user can look back on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis and see how much they have spent. When you're saving for a car, house, or just a nice vacation you forget to add in those fun, last minute happy hours with co-workers. DeDe seeks to not only help the user be responsible, safe and not make decisions they'll regret in the morning but also to make healthier choices and assist in money management! 

"Meet DeDe and Drink Responsibly!"

## The Future of DeDe:

* The User will add their set parameters for DeDe to help them on a night out:
    - After 2 drinks DeDe will remind the user "Don't forget to hydrate!"

    - After 3 drinks DeDe will say to the user "Try to wait an hour before your next drink!"

    - After 4 drinks DeDe will ask the user "Would you like me to shut off your social media?" or "Would you like me to block your ex-boyfriend from calling and texting?"

    - After 4 drinks DeDe will always ask "Would you like me to call you a ride now?" and the user will be connected to Uber where they can safely call a sober driver to pick them up when they're ready.

    - DeDe will have a calorie count and when the user stops their "night out" DeDe will announce "you have averaged X calories tonight, drink a glass of water before bed and take a nice walk in the morning!" 

    - DeDe will have a daily, weekly and monthly calender of the average the user has spent on outings that involved alcohol in that month. DeDe can make suggestions "maybe try a good happy hour or drink at home this month" to assist the user in making more informed monetary choices. 

    - A report of the calories consumed and money spent for the month and year overall so the users can plan for the future accordingly.
